Title: R-based Tests for the singlepp C++ code
Version: 0.1.0
Date: 2022-05-31
Description: 
    Some extra tests for the singlepp code, migrated from the SingleR package.
    Well, I already wrote them in R, so it would be a shame to not re-use them here.
    This allows us to get rid of the heavier tests in the SingleR package.
