/**
 * @brief Classify cells from a single pre-built reference dataset.
 *
 * This class uses the pre-built reference from `BasicBuilder` to classify each cell in a test dataset.
 * The algorithm and parameters are the same as described for the `Classifier` class;
 * in fact, `Classifier` just calls `BasicBuilder::run()` and then `BasicScorer::run()`.
 *
 * It is occasionally useful to call these two functions separately if the same reference dataset is to be used multiple times,
 * e.g., on different test datasets or with different parameters.
 * In such cases, we can save time by avoiding redundant builds;
 * we just have to call `BasicScorer::run()` in all subsequent uses of the pre-built reference.
